Sabayomikun is a semi-automatic viral foci counting system.
The phrase, "Saba wo yomu" implies incorrect, or very
roughly counted numbers. Therefore, "sabayomikun" means
"Mr. Miscount".
The icons of the softwares come from a medical book
"Harikikigaki" which published in Japan in the 15th century.
These strange creatures are explained as pathogens. To see
the original book, please visit Kyushu National Museum.
If you think this system is useful for your work, I will
continue to improve and maintain this system.
